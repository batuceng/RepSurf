We downloaded the data of the model. We run init.sh for setup of the environment and dataset (at the classification task). 
We have also started by checking how does "original_repo/classification/modules/repsurface_utils.py" has defined "UmbrellaSurfaceConstructor" class and inspected "cal_normal" function in detail.
We have checked torch.contiguous function and how does it relates to memory alignment of tensor data.
We have visualized the given example data at the "visualization" folder.
